# EatIt

This project is a food-delivery app that will deliver home-cooked food. Young adults residing away from home hired cooks in the pre-COVID era to get home-cooked food.
During the pandemic, they had the choice of either ordering food online or learning how to cook. While the 1st was unhealthy and was becoming pricier each day, the 2nd was time-consuming. Many cooks were left unemployed. This project will help solve such problems.

This app will have the following functionality:

1.	Cooks can post their menu (“Today’s menu”), and the user can choose and order from these posts.

2.	If the user orders 2-3 hours before the delivery time, he/she can post their choice as a request. The cooks can accept the request and specify the charges. The user can then accept the best price. 

3.	The delivery app will show the real-time position of the delivery person on a map.
